var:
•	var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped .
•	var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope. 
•	var variables are initialized with undefined, 
•	var  can be declared without being initialized

let: 
•	let is block scoped.
•	let variables can be updated but not re-declared. 
•	let  variables are not initialized.
•	let can be declared without being initialized.


const: 
•	const is block scoped.
•	const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
•	const variables are not initialized.
•	const must be initialized during declaration.


eg:
if (true) {
  var alpha = 'godzilla!';
  let beta= 'gorilla';
  const gama = 'chimpanzee!';

  console.log(alpha); // 'godzilla!';
 
  console.log(beta); // 'gorilla';
  console.log(gama); // 'chimpanzee!';
}

console.log(alpha); // 'godzilla!';
console.log(beta); // ReferenceError: beta is not defined
console.log(gama); // ReferenceError: gama is not defined
Notice the visibility of  alpha isn’t limited by the if-statement block. However, both beta and gama are limited in visibility to the block of code.
